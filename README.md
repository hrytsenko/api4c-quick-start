# API4C Quick start

A quick start to API development with modern tools:

1. Choose specification format.
1. Share contracts via *repo* for circulation.
1. Enforce rules via *lint* for consistency.
1. Detect changes via *diff* for continuity.
1. Verify implementations via *proxy* for conformance.

For [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) consider [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) as API client and [Apicurio Registry](https://www.apicur.io/registry/) as API registry for circulation, [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) as design linter for consistency, [OpenAPI Diff](https://www.oasdiff.com/) as breaking changes detector for continuity, [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) as mock server and [Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism) as validation proxy for conformance.

*See* [API4C](https://hrytsenko.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API4C/pages/2601058305/API4C+Framework) for details.
