# API4C Quick start

Follow these steps:

1. Choose specification format.
1. Share contracts via *repo* for circulation.
1. Enforce rules via *lint* for consistency.
1. Detect changes via *diff* for continuity.
1. Verify implementations via *proxy* for conformance.

Consider these tools:

1. [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) as API specification.
1. [Apicurio Registry](https://www.apicur.io/registry/) as API registry for circulation.
1. [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) as design linter for consistency.
1. [OpenAPI Diff](https://www.oasdiff.com/) as change detector for continuity.
1. [Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism) as validation proxy for conformance.

Additionally, consider these tools:

1. [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) as mock server for emulation.
1. [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) as API client for exploration.
